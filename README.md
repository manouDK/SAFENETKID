The “web App” file contains the code for our web application which allows us to test the model.
To use it, you must first install the following elements in a notebook:
    - tensorflow
  	- dash
  	- dash_core_components
  	- dash_html_components
   
To do this, use the following commands:
    - !pip install tensorflow
  	- !pip install dash
  	- !pip install dash-core-components dash-html-components

Once the installations are complete, you can launch the application by compiling the code found in the “web App” file.
Once the application is launched, when you want to make a prediction on an image, you must copy it to the same folder as that of
“web App” to facilitate its location. Then in the app you can select it and make the prediction.
